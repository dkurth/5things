# Five Things

The 5 Things Generator is intended to facilitate rehearsing the game of 5 Things by automatically generating an active activity and three substitutions.

The 5 Things Generator contains the following features:

    Random suggestions of active activities and associated substitutions pulled from a user-generated database
    Substituted items drawn from a dictionary of nouns
    Interface for users to add activities and substitutes to the database*
    Ability for users to specify that items be replaced with person, animal, place, and/or thing
    Text recognition to help minimize duplicated entries in the database
    A searchable text document showing the contents of the database

This script was developed independently by a CSz player (who came up with the idea) and a software programmer (who did all the actual work). No endorsement from CSz or any other organization has been given or implied.

*When entering suggestions, please enter only suggestions that would be accepted in a family-friendly match with the Brown-Bag foul in full effect.

# Five Things

This is a very quick-and-dirty tool for generating situations for the improv game "Five Things."

Here's a description of Five Things from the [Improv Encyclopedia](http://improvencyclopedia.org/games/Five_Things.html):

One player leaves the stage while the Host asks for an everyday activity. Then, audience and host will change 5 things about that activity. Example: suggestion is feeding the cat. One might change the following:

- change the cat into something else, say a tiger
- change the verb into some other verb, say deep frying
- change the location from where one might feed the cat. Say the Vatican.
- change the character. Say character changes from cat-owner to postman
- add interaction with a famous person, say Elvis.

After that the 1st player is brought back in and a scene is played in Gibberish . The other players have exactly 5 minutes to make the first player guess each of the five things.
